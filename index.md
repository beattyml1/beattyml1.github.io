# Software Engineer
I am a full stack web software engineer and core team member for [Abstractions Conference](http://abstractions.io) and [Code & Supply](http://codeandsupply.co). I currently do full stack web development on a SPA + multi-service REST API web platform [Net Health](http://nethealth.com). 

I love great user experiences, fast iterative development and learning, maintainable code, quick feedback loops, the local software community, continuous learning, positive corporate cultures, and diversity in tech. I really like hard problems and delight in accomplishing the seemingly impossible. I spend my life outside the box but love best practices and sensible defaults. I have a handful of strong opinions but but generally hold loosely and embrace the unknown. I am firm believer in intentional, measured, data-driven development but believe the best way to get that data whether market fit or user-friendliness is just to dive in and try it and see what happens.

Some of my best fits would be:
- At a startup that values passion, cleverness, and flexibility over bullet point tech matches: I love the unkown, am biased toward action, value autonomy, and love working with customers and stakeholders directly. 
- A medium sized company that has there shit together: I care about code quality and love good process that helps me get shit done and produces a great product and code but can't stomach red tape. Such a company should be doing pull requests, CI, automated testing, and should be have an agile framework in place as well as an agile mindset for the company.
- A smaller, older company looking to have someone take a leading roll in modernizing their UI/Code/Process: I've done stuff like this before both as a junior and as senior developer. I know this problem well. This would probably work best in the tech I know best (JavaScript/TypeScipt on Frontend, C# Web API backend)

Tech Wise: 
- Frontend:I love JavaScript/TypeScript and have acheived master over it and would want to continue working in JavaScript. I have tried all of the major frontend frameworks and have extensive experience with one of them.
- Backend: Most of my professional backend experience is in C# and most of my side projects are node or ruby. I love functional languages so huge bonus points if you want to hire me for that
- Source Control: Git or git out
- OS: I love my Mac and do my side projects on it, I use Windows at work and for gaiming, I used to run Linux back in college. I've configured both Linux and Windows Servers before. 

Side projects: 

- [codgen](https://github.com/beattyml1/codgen): an open source template+JSON model based code generator written in Ruby. Complete but idle due to lack of use
- [Metabolic](https://github.com/beattyml1/MetaPotatoes): a work in progress, open source, dynamic UI, React.js library for complex forms including complex fields like tables and relationship selection. This is my current project
- [Clever Web Framework](https://github.com/beattyml1/Clever): a clever convention first .NET N-Tier web framework that gracefully falls back to configurations. Support for things like smart auto-mapping, build in isomorphic react, and generally writing as little code as possible and getting up and running as quick as possible. Currently incomplete and shelved but with enough work to be interesting
- A backend and model editor for for Metabolic probably called Updoc running on Node and React

# Music Producer
As a hobby I also record/produce music. Mostly I record other people. If you want to here some of what I've done check it out below. If you're interested in working together feel free to private message me on Twitter.

# Other Hobbies
In what little free time I have left I really like doing cool things with food and drink: cooking, baking, good tea and coffee. Recently I've started learning to brew tea in the traditional Chinese "Gong Fu Cha" or Kong Fu Tea style (litterally: tea with great skill). I also enjoy mixing drinks, I started with alcoholic drinks but got good enough that lately I've been trying my hand at more virgin drinks, for the challenge, since it's harder to get a good flavor without making it too sweet. And of course I love using all these things to do some awesome entertaining!
