# Software Engineer
I am a full stack web software engineer. I'm passionate about great UX and highly maintainable and performant code. I like really hard problems: if you tell me something can't be done I will try to prove you wrong.

I am very active in Code & Supply (Pittsburg's polyglot tech community) as a board member, event planner, and speaker.

I currently do full stack web development in Multi-SPA, TypeScript+Knockout, frontend and Multi-Service, RESTful, N-Tier, C# Backend. Woo, that was a lot of adjectives.

I also maintain [codgen](https://github.com/beattyml1/codgen): an open source template+JSON model based code generator. I am also currently working on a Web UI for creating models for it called [DevCommand](https://www.devcommand.co/), it's not officially launched but you can still check it out. Both are written in Ruby. 

I’m pretty happy where I am now but I like new challenges so if you think you’ve got a super awesome project that I would be interested in private message me on Twitter.

# Music Producer
As a hobby I also record/produce music. Mostly I record other people. If you want to here some of what I've done check it out below. If you're interested in working together feel free to private message me on Twitter.
