# Software Engineer
I am a full stack web software engineer and core team member for [Abstractions Conference](http://abstractions.io) and [Code & Supply](http://codeandsupply.co). I currently do full stack web development on a SPA + multi-service REST API web platform at [Net Health](http://nethealth.com). 

- I am passionate about great user experiences and dabble in design. I lose track of time when doing responsive layout 
- I am love learning, I relish moving fast but also doing things right. Rapid iteration and measuring results is my way to have it all
- I really like hard problems
- I spend my life outside the box but love best practices and sensible defaults
- I have a handful of strong opinions but but generally hold loosely and embrace the unknown
- I'm kind of a corporate culture/agile/lean nerd. 


Some of my best fits would be:

- At a startup that values passion, cleverness, and flexibility over bullet point tech matches: I love the unkown, am biased toward action, value autonomy and impact, and enjoy working with customers and stakeholders directly. I also know a good bit about scaling process that would be useful at growth stage.
- A medium sized company that has their shit together: I care about code quality and love good process that helps me get shit done and produces a great product and code but can't stomach red tape. Such a company should be doing pull requests, CI, automated testing, and should be have an agile framework in place as well as an agile mindset for the company.
- A smaller, older company looking to have someone take a leading roll in modernizing their UI/Code/Process: I've done stuff like this before both as a junior and as senior developer. I know this problem well. This would probably work best in the tech I know best (JavaScript/TypeScipt on Frontend, C# Web API backend)
- A Quality focused Agile Consultancy: I love trying new things, going where the need is, working with many different techs, moving fast, and iterating. I believe that good work equals repeat customers. I would be especially valueable as a senior consultant for modernization projects whether UI, code, process, or tooling. I've done it multiple times with increasing responsibility, know the pitfalls, what tools are available, how to speed up the project without killing quality, and can balance presenting a solution and presenting a range of options. 

Tech Wise: 

- Frontend:I love JavaScript/TypeScript and have acheived master over it and would want to continue working in JavaScript. I have tried all of the major frontend frameworks and have extensive experience with one of them.
- Backend: Most of my professional backend experience is in C# and most of my side projects are node or ruby. I love functional languages so huge bonus points if you want to hire me for that
- Source Control: Git or git out
- OS: I love my Mac and do my side projects on it, I use Windows at work and for gaiming, I used to run Linux back in college. I've configured both Linux and Windows Servers before. 

Side projects: 

- [Metatonic](https://github.com/beattyml1/metatonic-platform): A dynamic data entry TypeScript library that can create complex forms from a simple JSON or TypeScript schema. Created as a core module that is view framework agnostic and react module that implements the actually editors/views. Work in progress but with significant progress.
- [codgen](https://github.com/beattyml1/codgen): an open source template+JSON model based code generator written in Ruby. Complete but idle due to lack of use

# Music Producer
As a hobby I also record/produce music. Mostly I record other people. If you want to here some of what I've done check it out below. If you're interested in working together feel free to private message me on Twitter.

# Other Hobbies
In what little free time I have left I really like doing cool things with food and drink: cooking, baking, good tea and coffee. Recently I've started learning to brew tea in the traditional Chinese "Gong Fu Cha" or Kong Fu Tea style (litterally: tea with great skill). I also enjoy mixing drinks, I started with alcoholic drinks but got good enough that lately I've been trying my hand at more virgin drinks, for the challenge, since it's harder to get a good flavor without making it too sweet. And of course I love using all these things to do some awesome entertaining!
