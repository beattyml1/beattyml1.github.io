# Software Engineer
I am a full stack web software engineer and core team member for [Abstractions Conference](http://abstractions.io) and [Code & Supply](http://codeandsupply.co). I currently do full stack web development on a TypeScript SPA frontend and multi-service RESTful C# web API at [Net Health](http://nethealth.com). 

I love great user experiences, fast iterative development and learning, highly maintainable code, quick feedback loops, the local software community, continuous learning, positive corporate cultures, and diversity in tech. I really like hard problems and delight in accomplishing the impossible. I spend my life outside the box but love best practices and sensible defaults. I have a handful of strong opinions but but generally hold loosely and embrace the unknown. I am firm believer in intentional, measured, trial and error.


Side projects: 

- [codgen](https://github.com/beattyml1/codgen): an open source template+JSON model based code generator written in Ruby.
- [Metabolic](https://github.com/beattyml1/MetaPotatoes): a work in progress, open source, dynamic UI, React.js library for complex forms including complex fields like tables and relationship selection.
- [Clever Web Framework](https://github.com/beattyml1/Clever): a clever convention first .NET N-Tier web framework that gracefully falls back to configurations. Support for things like smart auto-mapping, build in isomorphic react, and generally writing as little code as possible and getting up and running as quick as possible. New Project/Work in Progress
- A backend and model editor for for MetaPotatoes probably called Updoc running on Node and React

I'm open to new possibilities but am only passively looking and so will only entertain top notch offers. If you think you've got an awesome project at an awesome company with a worthy compensation package get in touch. 

I'm doing senior level work where I am right now and would be interested in senior level positions in Full Stack C# and TypeScript/JavaScript or well paying mid level in techs like Node, F#, Elixir, or Scala.

# Music Producer
As a hobby I also record/produce music. Mostly I record other people. If you want to here some of what I've done check it out below. If you're interested in working together feel free to private message me on Twitter.

# Other Hobbies
In what little free time I have left I really like doing cool things with food and drink: cooking, baking, good tea and coffee. Recently I've started learning to brew tea in the traditional Chinese "Gong Fu Cha" or Kong Fu Tea style (litterally: tea with great skill). I also enjoy mixing drinks, I started with alcoholic drinks but got good enough that lately I've been trying my hand at more virgin drinks, for the challenge, since it's harder to get a good flavor without making it too sweet. And of course I love using all these things to do some awesome entertaining!
