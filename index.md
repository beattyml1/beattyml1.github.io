# Software Engineer
I am a full stack web software engineer and core team member for [Abstractions Conference](http://abstractions.io) and [Code & Supply](http://codeandsupply.co). I currently do full stack web development on a TypeScript SPA frontend and multi-service RESTful C# web API at [Net Health](http://nethealth.com) along. 

Some things I'm passionate about: 

Great UX, highly maintainable code, fast iterative development and learning, the local software community, continuous learning, positive corporate cultures, and tech diversity. I like really hard problems: if you tell me something can't be done I will try to prove you wrong.


Side projects: 

- [codgen](https://github.com/beattyml1/codgen): an open source template+JSON model based code generator written in Ruby.
- [MetaPotatoes](https://github.com/beattyml1/MetaPotatoes): an open source dynamic UI react library for complex forms including tables and relationship selection.
- A backend and model editor for for MetaPotatoes probably called Updoc running on node and react

I'm open to new possibilities but not really actively looking at the moment and so will only entertain top notch offers. If you think you've got an awesome project at an awesome company with a worthy compensation package get in touch.

# Music Producer
As a hobby I also record/produce music. Mostly I record other people. If you want to here some of what I've done check it out below. If you're interested in working together feel free to private message me on Twitter.

# Other Hobbies
In what little free time I have left I really like doing cool things with food and drink: cooking, baking, good tea and coffee. Recently I've started learning to brew tea in the traditional Chinese "Gong Fu Cha" or Kong Fu Tea style (litterally: tea with great skill). I also enjoy mixing drinks, I started with alcoholic drinks but got good enough that lately I've been trying my hand at more virgin drinks, for the challenge, since it's harder to get a good flavor without making it too sweet. And of course I love using all these things to do some awesome entertaining!
