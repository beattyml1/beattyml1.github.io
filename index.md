# Software Engineer
I am a full stack web software engineer. Lately I have been really into frontend development and dev opsy things but I have a background ranging from web backend, to web frontend, to native Windows, to embedded Linux.

I am the maintainer of the open source codgen code generator (written in ruby), an active member of Pittsburgh Code & Supply (Pittsburgh’s polyglot software meetup). I also dabble in other projects and and occasionally attend pghruby and pghdotnet meetups. I am passionate about maintainable, loosely coupled code, automated testing, and a great user experience. I think that JavaScript is a horrible language but I love working in it.

I currently do full stack web development and continuous integration administration in a Microsoft MVC environment at a medical records software company in Pittsburgh’s cultural district. I’m pretty happy where I am now but I like new challenges so if you think you’ve got a super awesome project that I would be interested in get in touch using the contact form, or check me out on GitHub, Twitter, or LinkedIn using the links below.
